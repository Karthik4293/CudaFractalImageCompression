        <!-- Second Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="proposal">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Background
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Fractal Image Compression had its heyday in the early 90s (even being chosen as the image compression algorithm for all images in Microsoft’s Encarta Encyclopedia <a href="http://www.math.psu.edu/tseng/class/Fractals.html" target="_blank">[link]</a>) but it was never able to eclipse JPEG. Its main disadvantage compared to JPEG compression is high computation time for compression, which is what we would like to address for this project.</p>

            <p class="lead">The key insight behind fractal image compression is that self similarity exists in many images, and that this self similarity can be exploited to compress an image. Specifically, fractal image compression looks to find affine transformations from chunks of an image, called domain blocks, to every smaller chunk of the image, called range blocks (which partition the image).These transformations form an iterated function system <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system" target="_blank">(IFS)</a> on the image, and if the transformations are chosen correctly, this IFS will converge to the original image for any input. The compressed image, then, is just a file representing the IFS.</p>

            <p class="lead"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collage_theorem" target="_blank">The Collage Theorem</a> describes how we can find the appropriate affine transformations to make up our IFS. In layman’s terms, this theorem says that the best way to find the desired affine transformation for a range block is to find the transformation-domain block pair whose result is most similar to the range block. Finding this mapping for every range block defines the IFS, and thus the compressed image.</p>

            <p class="lead">Decoding the image, which we will not be focusing on for this project, simply involves iterating the IFS on any input image until it converges. The image it converges to will be the original image before compression (with some loss).</p>

            <img class=" img-responsive pull-left" src="images/monkeys.JPG">
            <p><a href="http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~agupta/_projects/image_processing/web/FractalImageCompression/" target="_blank">Picture source</a>

            </p>

            <p class="lead">We believe the image encoding can be heavily parallelized. The first step of the encoding is to create a codebook, or set of transformed domain blocks. This can be as simple as partitioning the image into squares, and computing each of the 8 affine transformations possible for that square (rotations of 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees on the normal and mirrored versions of the block). All of these transformations can be computed in parallel.</p>

            <p class="lead">Next, the best element of the codebook must be computed for each range block. This involves comparing each range block to each domain block using some distance metric, and choosing the codebook element that minimizes this distance (Collage Theorem). This, again can be parallelized -- at least across range blocks, and possibly across range block-codebook element pairs (to compute distances) with a final min function on the distances for each range block.</p>

            <p class="lead">A further improvement to the project could involve adding support for color images, which naively could be looked at as compressing each channel as a greyscale image (which could be done in parallel, as well). Additionally, we could investigate methods for pruning the codebook, so as to decrease the number of possible transformations to be considered for each range block. This could also present an opportunity for parallelization.</p>

        <div class="featurette" >
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Challenge
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">While most of the base algorithm described has clear parallelism, there are still several unanswered questions. For instance, when computing the codebook, there are several way we could attack the problem. One way is to only parallelize across domain blocks, having a single CUDA thread compute all 8 transformations for the block. Another way is to use a CUDA thread for each block-transformation pair. While this is more parallelized, it also requires half of the transformation threads to redundantly compute the mirror of the block. A final approach could be to still parallelize across blocks and transformations but use shared memory to reduce the redundant calculations.</p>

            <p class="lead">Other challenges include determining how to parallelize the determination of the best codebook element for each range block. Again, there are multiple possible dimensions to parallelize across, each with their own tradeoffs.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Resources
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">For our project, we plan to start both the sequential and the CUDA implementations from scratch, though we both have some experience with the algorithm from a math class. Additionally, there are several papers about fractal image compression available on the internet.</p>

            <p class="lead">We plan to use either the GTX 780 GPUs in the GHC clusters, or one of the more powerful GPUs in the latedays cluster for our project.<p>

            <p class="lead">For our demo we plan to show analysis of our CUDA implementation versus the sequential version.

            <h4>Defining a Compressed File Format</h4>
            <p>
                It took us quite a bit of time to think about, formalize, and document the compressed file format that we plan on using for this assignment. Our full specification and some of our thoughts on it can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/critcher/CudaFractalImageCompression/blob/master/docs/CompressedFileFormatSpec.md" target="_blank">docs</a>.
            <h4>Structuring our Project and Setting up our Environment</h4>
            <p>
                So far, we have spent a lot of time structuring our project and generally setting up our development environment. The structure of our project mimmics Assignment 2's structure, but most of the Assignment 2 code had to be scrapped. The structure is basically the only thing that makes our project similar to Assignment 2, the actual implementation that we are creating is quite different. The benchmarking process was something that we really wanted for this assignment since we will be comparing a sequential implementation to many paralled implementations. We were able to successfully build and run the project. 
            </p>
            <h4>Defining Classes and APIs</h4>
            <p >
                In order to start implementation, we had to define a set of classes and APIs that we would be working with. We defined APIs for our <a href="https://github.com/critcher/CudaFractalImageCompression/blob/master/src/compressor.h" target="_blank">Compressor</a> and <a href="https://github.com/critcher/CudaFractalImageCompression/blob/master/src/decompressor.h" target="_blank">Decompressor</a>. 
            </p>
            <h4>Redesigning the Image Representation</h4>
            <p>
                Additionally, we have redesigned the <a href="https://github.com/critcher/CudaFractalImageCompression/blob/master/src/image.h" target="_blank">Image</a> representation from Assignment 2 and have begun to develop our own compressed image representation (or at least the data needed to write this). We created a <a href="https://github.com/critcher/CudaFractalImageCompression/blob/master/src/fractal.h" target="_blank">fractal.h</a> file where we hope to store the fractal image data structures that can be shared across our sequential and parallel implementations. We plan on having our representations of Domain/Range Blocks be wrappers of the existing Image class so that transformations can be defined and applied at the Image level. We have already created a <a href="https://github.com/critcher/CudaFractalImageCompression/commit/fd469c14af665035dbaad62922ec57700fa85069" target="_blank">resize</a> function and plan to create more. 
            </p> 
            <h4>Codebook Generation</h4>
            <p>
                At this point, we are working on sequential codebook generation. We were a caught a bit off guard by the work needed to read in input files and the amount of time it would take parse these and create Image objects to represent them. After some work, we were finally able to read in a PPM file and display it correctly using our own hacked version of the Assignment 2 display code. 
            </p>
            <h4>Schedule</h4>
            <p>
                We updated our schedule to reflect the work we have done so far and the work we plan on doing in the future. We are mostly pair programming this project because it is how we have successfully worked on the previous assignments for this class. For this reason, we are a bit hesitant to name owners of various tasks, but we know it's what you guys want to see so we have put them down. New tasks have been added to our schedule to reflect some of the unexpected work we accomplished and also the new work we realized we will need to do in the future. We hope to be finished with a sequential implementation and on to a paralled implementation soon.
